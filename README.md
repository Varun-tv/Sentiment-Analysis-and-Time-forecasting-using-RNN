# Sentiment-Analysis-and-Time-forecasting-using-RNN
Here, RNN model is used to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. The dataset
consists of a collection of 50,000 movie reviews from IMDB, which are labeled as either positive or
negative. The dataset is preprocessed so that each review is represented as a sequence of integers, where
each integer corresponds to a specific word in a dictionary of the most frequent words. The reviews are
also truncated or padded to a fixed length, to ensure that all inputs to the model have the same shape.
